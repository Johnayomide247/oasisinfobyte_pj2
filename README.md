data cleaning
In this project, I work with a dataset to perform data cleaning. Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. Messy data leads to unreliable outcomes. Cleaning data is an essential part of data analysis, and demonstrating your data cleaning skills is key to landing a job.

Objectives
•	To perform data cleaning using excel as the cleaning tools
•	Data Integrity: Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the cleaning process.
•	Missing Data Handling: Dealing with missing values by either imputing them e.g replacing empty column under names with unknown name ,and also doing the same thing for host column by replacing blank space with unknown host, replacing empty columns with mean(average) and using modes also for last reviews which contains date
•	Duplicate Removal:-checking through the entire data set to remove any duplicates
•	Standardization:- formatting each roles and columns properly e.g text column should be formatted with text while number should be in number format.
•	Outlier Detection: Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis or model
performance, using the this (check for Q3 and Q1 ,IQR, lower outlier =Q1-(1.5*IQR),upper outlier=Q3+(1.5*IQR)

Datasets
The data set contains :- name , host name, host id ,price, numbers of reviews, last reviews etc
